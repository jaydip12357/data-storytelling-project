# Data Storytelling: The Untold Stories in Public Stroke Trial Data

## Project Overview  
In this project, we explore the **International Stroke Trial (IST)** dataset to uncover compelling stories about stroke outcomes, risk factors, and treatment effects. Our aim is not just to run analyses, but to communicate insights in a way that is engaging, clear, and accessible to a broader audience. We will highlight patterns, surprises, and caveats—especially around bias, missing data, and ethical concerns.
